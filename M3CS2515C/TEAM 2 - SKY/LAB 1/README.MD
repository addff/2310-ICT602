# Step 1: Download Flutter SDK

    Go to the official Flutter website: Flutter.dev.

    Click on the "Get Started" button.

    Download the Flutter SDK for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

# Step 2: Extract Flutter Archive

    Once the download is complete, extract the compressed archive to a location on your computer. For example, on Windows, you can extract it to C:\flutter.

# Step 3: Add Flutter to System Path

    Windows:
        Open the System Properties.
        Click on "Advanced system settings" and then click on the "Environment Variables" button.
        Under "System variables," find and select the "Path" variable, then click "Edit."
        Click "New" and add the path to the bin directory inside the Flutter directory (e.g., C:\flutter\bin).

# Step 4: Install Flutter Dependencies

    Open a new terminal or command prompt.

    Run the following command to check for Flutter dependencies: flutter doctor
    This command will check your system for any missing dependencies.

    Install any missing dependencies suggested by the flutter doctor command.

# Step 5: Android Studio (Optional, but recommended)

    Download and install Android Studio: Android Studio.

    Open Android Studio, go to "Preferences" on macOS or "Settings" on Windows/Linux, and navigate to "Plugins."

    Search for the "Flutter" plugin, install it, and restart Android Studio.

# Step 6: Flutter Plugins for Editors

    If you're using Visual Studio Code, install the Flutter and Dart plugins from the VS Code marketplace.

    If you're using Android Studio, make sure the Flutter and Dart plugins are installed and enabled.

# Step 7: Verify Flutter Installation

    In the terminal, run the following command to ensure that Flutter is installed correctly: flutter --version
    Run the following command to see if there are any additional dependencies you need to install: flutter doctor
        Address any remaining issues reported by flutter doctor until all checks pass.
